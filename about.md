<p class="message">

Hello! And thanks for stopping by.

I am an electrical engineer by education and a software engineer by career experience.

I love software design and development. I am fascinated by the myriad technologies made possible by great, high quality software. For many years I worked on embedded software, implementing software projects and leading a few. Lately, I have developed an interest in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data. This blog is a record of my learning, experiences and adventures in these areas. Occasionally you will find posts related to a few of my other technical projects.
